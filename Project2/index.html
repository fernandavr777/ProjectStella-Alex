                    <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and                           Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. Markup language is used to define the text document within tag which defines                         structure of web pages. </p>

                    <p>This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most                     of markup (e.g. HTML) languages are human readable. Language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text.</p>

                        } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }</code>

               <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay out web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split                 it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery                 with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML.</p>

              <p>This module contains the following articles, which will take you through all the basic theory of CSS, and provide opportunities for you to test out               some skills.</p>
              <code>Selector => h1 Declaration => {color:blue;font size:12px;} </code>

              <p>JavaScript is a programming language that can be included on web pages to make them more interactive. You can use it to check or modify the contents                of forms, change images, open new windows and write dynamic page content. You can even use it with CSS to make DHTML (Dynamic HyperText Markup                Language). This allows you to make parts of your web pages appear or disappear or move around on the page. JavaScripts only execute on the page(s) that                are on your browser window at any set time. When the user stops viewing that page, any scripts that were running on it are immediately stopped. The only                exceptions are cookies or various client side storage APIs, which can be used by many pages to store and pass information between them, even after the                pages have been closed.</p>

              <p>Before we go any further, let me say; JavaScript has nothing to do with Java. If we are honest, JavaScript, originally nicknamed LiveWire and then               LiveScript when it was created by Netscape, should in fact be called ECMAscript as it was renamed when Netscape passed it to the ECMA for               standardisation.

              JavaScript is a client side, interpreted, object oriented, high level scripting language, while Java is a client side, compiled, object oriented high               level language. Now after that mouthful, here's what it means.</p>

                    <header>How to create a page</header>
             <p>When you navigate to a web page on the Internet, the browser is doing a lot of work. The browser reads all the necessary files (HTML, CSS, and               JavaScript) and interprets those raw resources to paint the complex page you see.

              In this article, you’ll learn how to create a web page using a text editor on your own computer, then view the web page in your browser. If you’re               interested in publishing your web page to the World Wide Web (the Internet) for everyone to see, check out this article after you understand the steps               below.</p> 


             <p>Word processors insert characters which make the page look good, but aren’t valid HTML. They’re great tools for making stylish documents, such as               academic papers and flyers, but they also insert characters that aren’t valid HTML. Since a web page file must contain valid HTML, a text editor is a               better tool than a word processor for building web pages.</p>

              <p>Pensar en interactividad cuando hacemos un sitio web es, en la gran mayoría de los casos, pensar en Javascript (¿o en Flash?). Acordeones, pestañas o                menús son algunos de los comportamientos que puede tener una página web. Ahora puedes hacer una de ellas con el uso HTML5… sin Javascript.</p>
              <p>You can use CSS within the document (or your email newsletter), and you can use it as a stand-alone file, that is referenced by the HTML document.

               CSS allows you to style any HTML element (or group of elements) in one place. It allows you to change an elements color, size, position, angle,                visibility, and much more.</p>
